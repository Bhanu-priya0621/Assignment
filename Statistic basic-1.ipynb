The categorical information involves categorical variables that describe the features such as a person’s gender, home town etc. Categorical measures are defined in terms of natural language specifications, but not in terms of numbers.Sometimes categorical data can hold numerical values (quantitative value), but those values do not have a mathematical sense. Examples of the categorical data are birthdate, favourite sport, school postcode. Here, the birthdate and school postcode hold the quantitative value, but it does not give numerical meaning.\n",

Numerical data gives information about the quantities of a specific thing. Some examples of numerical data are height, length, size, weight, and so on. The quantitative data can be classified into two different types based on the data sets. The two different classifications of numerical data are discrete data and continuous data."
